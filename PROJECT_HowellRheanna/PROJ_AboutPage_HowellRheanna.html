		<td colspan="2">The developer of the TypeWrite is Rheanna Howell. She has made a beta program of the website during her second year in college as a project. 
		Rheanna has taken inspiration from websites like Fanfiction.net and Archive of our Own to bring another resource to the fan community to post their stories about their
		favorite fandoms. The website is ambitious as a single programmer and will remain in the Alpha stage and refined over time before made public. She has created forums that allows 
		writers to post anonymously as a guest until accounts can be created. Forums are available for bug reports and suggestions on making the website more user-friendly for the public.

		<th colspan="3">Intention of Website</th>
		<td rowspan="5">The intent of TypeWrite is to allow fans to post their own stories and later their own artwork for their fics for others to view, much like Archive of our Own and
		Fanfiction.net does. As the website continues to grow thanks to input and assistance from other programmers, it will be more accessible to user's to continue posting their
		own stories for others to view and enjoy.<br>
